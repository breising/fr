# FeedReader 

This app is was created by Udacity as an exercise to practice using the Jasmine framwork for app testing...to be completed for the front-end web developer Nanodegree program. The app asynchronously gets and loads a list of web feed (urls) and provides 5 list options to choose from a slide out menu. The first list is displayed by default.
